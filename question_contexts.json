This meant that if grain was imported, it would be heavily taxed to make it expensive for people to buy.\n• **Reason for importance**: At the time, many people in the UK were struggling with poverty due to high prices of bread and other food items. The Corn Laws were seen as a major contributor to this problem.\n• **Common confusion to avoid**: Don't confuse the Corn Laws with laws that improved working conditions or built railways – they were separate issues.\n\n**Memory Hook**: \"Corn Laws = Cheap Grain?

Chieftains became landlords under English rule, and clan members became tenants.\n\n**Common confusion:** Don't be fooled by the option \"The King\" - while the king was involved in the battle, it's not who lost power as a result.\n**Memory hook**: Remember that \"Clans\" ends with an \"S\", so if you're choosing between \"The Clans\" and other options, stick with the one ending with an \"S\".",

It was a time of great change and upheaval in Europe.\n\n**Common confusion:** Some people might get confused with the Glorious Revolution, which actually occurred much later (1688) and involved the overthrow of King James II of England.

      "context": "Here's a concise learning context for the UK citizenship practice question:\n\n**Understanding the Bill of Rights**\n\n• The Bill of Rights, passed in 1689, was a significant document in British history that protected individual rights and limited the power of the monarch.\n• It confirmed the supremacy of Parliament and established certain fundamental liberties such as freedom from cruel treatment and protection from unreasonable searches.\n• This meant that Parliament's power increased, allowing it to hold the king accountable for his actions.\n\n**Common confusion:** Don't get confused between the Bill of Rights (1689) and the Human Rights Act (1998). While both are important documents, they have different purposes and effects.\n\n**Memory hook:** Remember \"BP\" - Bills Passed (like the Bill of Rights) to Protect People's Powers!",
